# Introduction

I went on a bike ride with a friend in October 2016 starting from King's Lynne and then following the Norfolk coast. This became a mission to cycle all of the British coast, with a sequence of short holidays over many years.

I've created a map of my progress so far along with a list of links to individual Strava rides.

```{r map}
#| echo: false
library(leaflet)
library(magrittr)
load("strava_data.Rds")

m <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()
for( df in coords_list){
  m <- addPolylines(m, data=df[[1]], lat=~lat,lng=~lon)
  
}
m
```

# Rides

```{r rides}
#| echo: false
library(kableExtra)
rides_df <- read.csv(file="activities.csv") %>% 
  na.omit()

rides_df |> 
  kableExtra::kbl(col.names = c("Title","Link")) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling() |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, link=rides_df$id)

```
