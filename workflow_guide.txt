1) The api link to strava only works in the local version of Rstudio, and not in the docker one
2) Update activities.csv  to add in new ride numbers from strava
3) run main.R with suitable edits to line 38, which details which rows are new. Don't try to re-download all rides, as takes too long, and strava probably says no

4) Now in the terminal window  > quarto render
5) commit and push to github
